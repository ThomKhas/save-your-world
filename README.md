*for the use of this script, you must configure correctly the repository to which you are pointing, this is in aws.py, then use ctrl+f and look for "link" and you will see the two places where you must make this change, since in this case it is pointing to a private one, where I am a collaborator.*

**Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**:
python -m venv venv
This creates a virtual environment in the venv directory. You can activate it using:

**On Windows:**

pip install -r requirements.txt
This installs the necessary dependencies for your project, which are located in the requirements.txt file.

python aws.py
Where aws.py is the main script of your project.
